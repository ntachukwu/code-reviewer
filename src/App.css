/* App.css - For specific overrides or styles not covered by Tailwind utility classes or global index.css */

/*
  Most of the initial global styles (like #root centering, logo, card, read-the-docs)
  were part of the default Vite+React setup and are no longer directly used or have been
  superseded by the Material Design restyling using Tailwind CSS and updates to index.css.

  This file can be kept for any future App-specific CSS that doesn't fit well into
  component styles or global utility-first classes.

  For example, if we needed very specific layout adjustments for the #root element
  that Tailwind's container class wasn't covering, we might add them here.
  However, for now, the combination of index.css for base Material styles and
  Tailwind utilities in components should cover most needs.
*/

/* Example: If we wanted to ensure #root takes full height if App.tsx's flex container wasn't enough */
/*
#root {
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
*/

/* Any remaining specific styles that were in App.css and are still needed should be evaluated.
   If they were for components that are now heavily styled with Tailwind, those CSS rules
   might conflict or be redundant. It's often cleaner to manage styling via Tailwind if possible.
